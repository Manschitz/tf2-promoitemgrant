### 4. Privacy Policy

The Software requires you to input a personal Steam Web API key which will not be stored or shared with any individual or third party by the Software in accordance with the ["Steam Web API Terms of Use"](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms). It will only be used for authorizing and making requests to the ["Steam Web API"](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) as specified in the ["Steam Web API Documentation"](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API).

The Software will store any end user's public Steam profile ID or URL that you process through the Software in a text file ("log.txt") in the same folder as the Application solely for the purpose of giving you the possibility of manually tracking and possibly revising errors in case of any erroneous behavior of the Software. This data will not be shared with any individual or third party by the Software.

The Software will store any end user's public Steam profile ID along with the item ID that is being generated by the Steam Web API when distributing a promotional item in a text file ("items_granted.csv") in the same folder as the Application solely for the purpose of preventing accidental distribution of multiple items of the same type to an end user. This data will not be shared with any individual or third party by the Software.

You are required to inform any end user about the storage of their Steam profile ID and URL and you must obtain permission from the end user for storing their Steam profile ID and URL before processing them through the Software. Please refer to the ["Steam Web API Terms of Use"](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms) for additional terms that apply for using the ["Steam Web API"](https://steamcommunity.com/dev).

You may delete any text files ("logs") created by the Software from the Application's folder at any time at your own risk to ensure that no end user data is being stored on your device. This will however prevent the Software from knowing which items have already been distributed by you.
