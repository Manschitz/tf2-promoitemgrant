## Description

Main purpose of the "Promotional Item Granting Utility" is to provide a graphical user interface for distributing promotional items (e.g. badges or medals) in Team Fortress 2 by utilizing the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev). It may be used by hosts of Team Fortress 2 community events (e.g. tournaments, contests and competitions) who have been given permission and access to distribute promotional items by [Valve Corporation](https://www.valvesoftware.com/).

## Features

- Look up any Steam user by a given Steam profile URL or SteamID64
- Import a list of Steam user profile URLs or IDs from a text file to distribute items to
- Distribute Team Fortress 2 promotional items to Steam users through the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)
- Logging of all actions and errors to a file
- Tracking of given items in a CSV file to prevent distribution of multiple items to users

## Possible future features

- Check a user's inventory directly through the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) for any existing items of the given type to prevent distributing duplicate items (instead of using a CSV file to track given items)
- Add manual cancelation to the item granting process so it can be stopped in case you'd like to pause or cancel while the distribution process is already running
- Add check on startup for any available updates to the Software

## Quick Start Guide

- Download the [latest installer](https://github.com/Manschitz/tf2-promoitemgrant/raw/release/Promoitemgrant_1.0_Setup.exe) and extract the files to your computer
- Enter your Steam Web API key under the "Settings" tab (get one from Steam at [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey))
- Either look up a single user profile or import a list of users from a text file (use only one profile URL or ID per line)
- Enter the item's promo ID that was given to you by Valve
- Click "Grant item to users..." to start the distribution process (this may take a few moments as a single request will be sent to the Steam Web API for each user)
